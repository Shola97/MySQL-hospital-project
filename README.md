# MySQL-hospital-project
Project title: Hospital

Description: A mySQL workbench project demonstrates how complex and varied patient data can be utilised to study and understand patient data. The idea was to show how SQL queries can be used to understand a patient population. I was inspired by: https://github.com/Strano1/SQL-for-Healthcare. From which the eight tables used for my database were derived and modified. 

This a view that was created called medical history: ![image](https://github.com/Shola97/MySQL-hospital-project/assets/107686145/519c6640-5a7c-4421-954f-ed00e7b484df)

Another view that was created was called care plan protocol: ![careplan protocol](https://github.com/Shola97/MySQL-hospital-project/assets/107686145/46adbb96-b1dd-4636-b31c-afeda5735a36)

Other queries demonstrated:
-How to update patient records
-Investigating patient demographics
-Calculation of outstanding patient cost

Please read mySQL code for more details.

This project was a team collaboration and was done under the instruction of Code First Girls.
