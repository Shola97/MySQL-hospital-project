# MySQL-hospital-project
Project title: Hospital

Description: A mySQL workbench project demonstrates how complex and varied patient data can be utilised to study and understand patient data. The idea was to show how SQL queries can be used to understand a patient population. I was inspired by: https://github.com/Strano1/SQL-for-Healthcare. The data was derived from an open source project called Syntheaâ„¢ where people contribute and sythnetic patient data.
